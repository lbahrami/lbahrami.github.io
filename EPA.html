                        <h4>The Story of How our Winning design proposal is Making a Real Difference to Andrew Hamilton School</h4>
                        <h3>Project Statement</h3>
                         <p> 
Andrew Hamilton Elementary School in West Philadelphia lacks green space, healthy food access, and stormwater management, underscoring the need for sustainable, food-producing green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) to support students and the community. Our design will reduce the school’s stormwater fees, mitigate local flooding, alleviate urban heat, and improve access to fresh food. Key features include a green roof, rain gardens, raised beds, a food forest, and permeable pavers. To engage students, we’ll add educational signage, watershed and nutrition-focused curricula, and a mural on urban water resilience. Partnering with school leadership and organizations like the Philadelphia Water Department, the Netter Center, and the Philadelphia Orchard Project, we aim to establish AHS as a sustainable community hub.

                          <h4>Experience Diversity</h4>
                          <br>
                          As Toronto becomes more diverse, both demographically and socio-economically, fewer spaces allow for the harmonious mingling of differences. Rising housing unaffordability segregates the city between the served and the under-served. Diversity of thought and experience, however, breeds creativity, compassion and community, and must be celebrated and promoted. The district will provide a home for those with diverse backgrounds, exchanging any financial burden with opportunity to thrive. Half of all housing will serve low-income and workforce housing. Furthermore, housing types will provide opportunities to rent and own, for families small and large.
                          <br>
                          Walking through the expansive Toronto Exchange Market, one will encounter, through sight, sound and smell, the incredible cultural diversity of Toronto. There, patrons will exchange not only in commerce, but also in experience.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <h4>Establish Resilience</h4>
                          <br>
                          The mighty Don River, running on the western edge of the Exchange District presents its immediately surrounding areas with great opportunity. Leveraging the site’s ecological resources, the district exchanges the flood liability with community assets. Residents and visitors alike will enjoy bountiful public green space, which include the extension of East Harbour’s River’s Edge Park and the new Flooded Shore Amphitheater.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          These amenities highlight the ideal of exchange. When the Don floods, the retaining wall protects the development and surrounding neighborhoods while directing water into the Amphitheater, which allows for water performances. The retaining wall and its redesign of the Don Valley Expressway, also create new Chinook Salmon habitat, whose return improves not only the river’s biodiversity, but also strengthens Ontario Lake’s fishing economy. Lastly, the green roofs and storm water collection system efficiently recycles storm water for consumer use.

                          <br>
                          <h4>Empower Community</h4>
                          <br>
                          One of many in this city of neighborhoods, the Exchange District seeks to establish an intimate yet welcoming community. Though thousands of visitors and workers will enter the region daily through one of the many public transit systems, the district will remain familiar to those who live there. Public space, such as the River’s Edge Trail and the Exchange Plaza, act as the district’s front lawn and sidewalk exchanging these strangers for neighbors.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Along the River’s Edge, new basketball and paddle tennis courts, along with jungle gyms, encourage those residents with mutual interests or with children to meet and enjoy each other. This trail, connecting East Harbor and West Don Lands via a pedestrian bridge, also opens the district to its immediate neighbors, allowing new serendipitous encounters and experiences. Exchange Plaza, provides a heart for the community. Intimately tucked among the many residences, it remains the singular space for this community to come together, celebrate, and thrive.
