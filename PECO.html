                        <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
                         <p> 
This project aimed to support PECO's commitment to equitable energy access by examining challenges and opportunities within Environmental Justice (EJ) areas in Southeastern Pennsylvania. 
                          <p>
                          As the leader responsible for the geospatial components and assessment of the Environmental Justice (EJ) study for PECO, I played a critical role in identifying spatial disparities and opportunities within disadvantaged communities in Southeastern Pennsylvania. My expertise in geospatial technologies and environmental assessment was pivotal in analyzing complex data sets, mapping EJ areas, and providing actionable insights to promote equitable energy access.

                          <h4>Project Sections</h4>                          
                          <p>                          
                          1. GIS Mapping Application: Developed a secure GIS-based tool to analyze PECO's service area, integrating datasets like demographic statistics, energy usage, and transportation data. The tool facilitated identifying EJ areas and informed case study selection.
2. Community Profiles: Created detailed profiles for selected urban and suburban EJ neighborhoods, incorporating historical energy burden data, demographics, and access to electrification. These profiles highlighted barriers and opportunities for energy solutions.
3. Community Engagement: Conducted focus groups and surveys with residents, community leaders, and organizations to map assets, understand local needs, and gather insights on electrification opportunities, such as EV charging infrastructure and home energy solutions.
4. Environmental and Social Analysis: Assessed air quality challenges, transportation electrification barriers, and household electrification opportunities. Recommendations included equity-focused strategies for infrastructure improvements and community-driven programs.
5. Address environmental injustices by mitigating the urban heat island effect and enhancing green space access.

                          <h4>Community Engagement and Education</h4>
                          <p>
                          Community engagement was central to this proposal. From the start, the school’s principal and faculty contributed to site selection and design, enabling collaboration with the local school district, which agreed to incorporate our stormwater design in its parking lot repaving project.

AHS students helped choose plants for the green infrastructure via class polls, with favorites including apples, tomatoes, and herbs. Lessons expanded to topics like food deserts and environmental justice.

The Netter Center and Philadelphia Orchard Project supported student engagement, GSI planning, and community connections. The Netter Center will hire staff for garden upkeep and develop educational content, while the Philadelphia Orchard Project will assist with the food forest. Students for Environmental Equity (SEE) engaged classrooms on environmental justice, native plants, and activism, empowering students to impact their community.
                          <br>                                                   
                          <br>
                          <h4>Design Solutions</h4>
                          <p>
To manage runoff, our design includes pervious pavers and subsurface storage around playground drains, ensuring functionality without disrupting student line-up areas. The school district’s upcoming parking lot resurfacing will be regraded to channel runoff into a rain garden.

The project includes 1,650 sq ft of rain gardens and an 11,140 sq ft green roof. The area between tree pits will be regraded to enhance stormwater absorption and support native plant growth. A food forest with fruit trees, vegetables, and herbs will encircle the school, with 36 raised beds for crops on the east side.

Community engagement features include inviting green spaces with benches, picnic tables, educational signage, and a mosaic mural. Additionally, UN Sustainable Development Goals will be painted in the lineup area, blending art and sustainability learning.

                          <h4>Implementation Funding</h4>
                          </p>
                        We have identified several government funding sources to support this project's planning and implementation. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection offers over 30 grants and rebates, including the Environmental Education Grants, Growing Greener, and Nonpoint Source Management programs, which directly benefit schools. The Philadelphia Water Department’s 25-year plan for waterway revitalization also provides funding through programs like the Stormwater Management Incentive Program (SMIP) for non-residential properties.

Additionally, 15 regional foundations, such as the William Penn Foundation and Exelon Foundation, support projects related to water resources and sustainable development in West Philadelphia. Combined, government funding could contribute up to $500,000, with foundations averaging $200,000.

The Philadelphia Orchard Project will fund plant materials and signage, while the Netter Center will supply materials for the raised beds, significantly reducing initial costs.
